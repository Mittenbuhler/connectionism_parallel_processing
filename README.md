# Parallel Processing and Representation Sharing in Neural Network Architectures
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook illustrating connectionist and graph-theoretical analyses of the parallel processing capacity in neural networks. It was presented at the Analytical Connectionism summer school 2023 at UCL. Once the accompanying lecture notes are published we will link them here.

## How to run in Google Colab (optional)
- Upload the `.ipynb` to your Google Drive
- Open the notebook
- Click "connect" in the top right corner to run the notebook on remote Google servers (no installation required)
